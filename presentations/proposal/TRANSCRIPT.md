## Slide 1

For our project we will be showing the voting trends in US elections at a national and state level in the 2016 election while examining the socioeconomic factors that influence these trends. Over the past few decades, the US has undergone serious political changes due to a large variety of factors.

## Slide 2

The most palpable is the increase in party polarization among US voters, where there are less moderate voters and more voters dedicated to a specific party, which can easily be influenced by socioeconomic changes. Some of these socioeconomic changes that influence a region’s party preference include, but are not limited to, job loss, gender and race demographic changes, and religious movements.

## Slide 3

For example, a large reason Trump won in 2016 was due to his focus on the Rust Belt states, circled in black, promising jobs and change to forgotten middle class blue collar workers in these so-called industrial “flyover states”. In addition, Trump bolstered the idea of “tearing down the establishment”, having stricter immigration policies, and supporting the working class nationwide drawing in more white voters.

## Slide 4

Trump’s win was a surprise to most analysts, especially with such a swing in the Rust Belt states. Thus, we want to see if there are any socioeconomic factors that could explain the results of the election. However, one of the challenges of this project is to show information beyond the election results on why certain regions lean toward Republican and Democrat affiliations.

## Slide 5

Our plan is to find correlations between voting results by region and their education status, age, gender, income distribution, and unemployment rate. By visualizing these voting patterns, we can find valuable insight into American voters. Some of our data sources will include the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Kaggle U.S. Elections dataset.

## Slide 6

We will create an interactive visualization of a map of the U.S. showing the total votes by region with a dropdown menu allowing the user to choose the socioeconomic category they are interested in. Hovering over a state will show aggregated statistics based on the dropdown choice. The user can click on a state and will be taken to a new page that shows more detailed visualizations based on the socioeconomic category chosen from a dropdown list to show correlations between these categories and voting decisions.

## Slide 7

Naturally, there has already been a lot of work done on this, for example this graphic paints a picture of the political paradigm in the United States as it relates to socioeconomic status. The strong correlation between share of U.S income and proportion of Republican voters is captivated with ease, and a lack of redundancy. We plan to integrate a similar philosophy in our visualizations.

## Slide 8

This is another similar visualization; it effectively breaks down demographics and their voting tendencies in regards to political parties in the United States. The graphic successfully visualizes and conveys the stark contrasts between various age, ethnic and religious groups. We will certainly be drawing influence and acknowledging economic, and social confounding variables that have a conveyable sway on political affiliation, and in turn extrapolate this on a more geographic and nationwide level.

## Slide 9

In terms of data and design considerations, we must consider the limitations of voting data and statewide socioeconomic data as to what is public and what we can visually depict. Furthermore, as we are dealing with a potentially large volume of data, especially with recent data, we must also be careful to include only metrics that are correlated with party preference, as well as location based data that coalesces with the electoral paradigm. 

## Slide 10

For our Project Development Plan, we will each create a separate visualization then put them together on a dashboard. In addition, Henry will create the presentations, Griffin will create the demo video, and Josh and Avi will take the lead on the paper. As for our timeline, we will spend one week brainstorming visualizations to show voting trends of interest. The rest of the time will be spent creating the visualizations along with the other aspects of the project. Note that we will be using D3.js, Node.js, HTML, and CSS for the data visualization, as well as pandas and numpy for the initial data formatting.
