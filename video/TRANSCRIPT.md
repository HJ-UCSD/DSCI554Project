## Intro

Hello everyone, we are Team Uncharted and our project goal is to tell the story of how regional demographics like income, race, and education influenced voting in the 2016 presidential election. In a time more politically polarized than ever, and fresh off a heated election, we found it appropriate and profound to dive deeper into the data behind american voters. In our research we found striking correlations and visually conveyed the reasons why someone votes the way they do.

Even with constant pushes to vote every four years, the United States traditionally trailed most developed countries in voter turnout rates. However, with the unique political climate in 2020, the presidential election results yielded the highest percentage turnout, demonstrated by this d3 line chart, and gross voter turnout of voter-eligible people ever. We wanted to capitalize on this unique data to lay the foundation to quickly analyze the voting trends in the 2020 election data once available. We will now look deeper into the data behind our elections.

The political paradigm we see today is unlike any of the past, especially in relation to wealth and politics. According to the New York Times, in the 1990's there was no strong correlation between the economic standing of a place and the partisan preference of its voters. By 2016, the Repulican Party won almost twice the share of votes in the nation's poorest counties than it won in the richest. In this d3 scatterplot we see an undeniable correlation between median household income and whether that state was won by Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump (blue or red, respectively) in the 2016 election. By hovering over California we are able to see the margin of victory for Hillary Clinton and its median income. It is remarkably divided between blue and red as you move along the axis. Clicking on a bubble will transition to a county-level scatter plot while still providing data on hover. The user can then click on the button on top to reset the chart to state-level statistics. Finally, the graph is also responsive to the window size.

Next, we wanted to look at the relationship between demographics and voting trends using a dynamic d3 choropleth map. With the dropdown we are able to easily navigate different metrics and display the data for each county. These metrics range from the percentage of blue collar workers to the percentage of children raised by a single parent. For example, if we look at the distribution of the African American population and then press “j” to switch to the 2016 election results and press “k” to switch back, we can clearly see a strong relationship between voting democrat and the African American population in 2016.

Moreover, we wanted to look at how subregions of the United States voted, and on top of that the county composition of each state. Our d3 bubble packing layout allows us to take a deeper dive into each region of the country, looking at how the state voted in 2016, with a clear preference of the south for the Republican Party, shown in red, and a preference of the west and northeast for the Democratic Party, shown in blue. The inner layer then lets us see an abstract comparison of the total number of red and blue counties within each state receiving the majority vote. It is no surprise that in predominantly red states we see very few blue counties, such as Alaska who had none. But on top of that, even some extremely left states still consist of primarily red counties, such as Oregon, however this is due to concentration of democratic voters in large cities, such as Portland. Moreover, this graph demonstrates concentration of blue and red voters in each state as a larger difference between the size of the inner circles indicates how spread out blue voters are in each state.

Finally, our final map demonstrates which counties flipped from democrat to republican between the 2012 and 2016 election in Mapbox. These counties are represented by the color light salmon, and they extend across the United States. However, there is a large concentration in the midwest, which ended up being a pivotal subregion during the 2016 election. Nevertheless, this encapsulates the motive behind our research - counties and states party preference are not random events but a result of the people within them and their day to day realities. What helped Trump win in 2016 wasn’t just his message, but clearly the population for which it was targeted.

## Conclusion

In our research we confirmed our hypothesis and assumptions, while also discovering surprising trends within the data. Furthermore, by effectively visualizing the data we are able to see the troubling paradigm we as Americans face today in our political climate. Someone’s wealth, education, and location do not just impact their day to day life but strongly dictate what party they support - more so than we could have ever imagined.

Thank you.
